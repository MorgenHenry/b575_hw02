## What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
# The most challenging part of this assignment was being able to troubleshoot when certain actions I tried to
# perform resulted in an error. There were many resources to figure out how to navigate remotely accessing Git. I
# imagine I will use these same resources in the future!

## What is one element you learned about git and GitHub through this experience?
# I learned about sitching between branches on Terminal. I also learned how to correctly submit a pull request
# through the GitHub portal.
